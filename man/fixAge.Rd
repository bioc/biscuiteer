\description{
Uses Horvath-type 'epigenetic clock' raw output to project into actual ages
}
\details{
The 'Epigenetic Clock' (Horvath 2012) and similar schemes use a number of
CpG loci (or regions, or perhaps CpH loci -- it doesn't really matter what)
to estimate the chronological/biological age of samples from DNA methylation
with pre-trained feature weights (coefficients) for each region/locus.

All of these type of clocks use a nonlinear output transformation which
switches from an exponential growth model for children into a linear model
for adults, where \code{adult} is an arbitrary number (by default and custom,
that number is 21; elsewhere it can sometimes be seen as 20, but all known
epi-age transformation functions quietly add 1 to the constant internally).

This function implements the above standard output transformation step.
